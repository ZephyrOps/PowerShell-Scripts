<# This file is based on PSML's Chapter 14 lab. To help identify WMI classes, I'll be using Vinay Pamnani's WMI Explorer which you can find at the link below:
https://github.com/vinaypamnani/wmie2/releases/tag/v2.0.0.2 #>

Get-WMIObject -class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration
<# Allows you to see the current IP address associated with each network adapter. If you pipe to gm, can you see ReleaseDHCPLease and RenewDHCPLease methods. #>

Get-WMIObject -class Win32_OperatingSystem -computer localhost | 
format-table @{label='ComputerName';expression={$_.__SERVER}},
@{label='OSBuildNumber';expression={$_.BuildNumber}},
@{label='OSDescription';expression={$_.Caption}},
@{label='BIOSSerial';expression={Get-WMIObject -class Win32_BIOS -computerName $_.__SERVER | 
select-object -expandProperty BIOSVersion}} -autoSize

<# Create table-formatted output that includes computer name, OS Build Number & Description, and BIOS Version. #>
